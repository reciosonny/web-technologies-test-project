NOTES:

1. The assemblies specified using the /a switch may, but are not require to,
contain the domain classes as well as the embedded .hbm.xml files. This allows
developers to separate their mapping files from the domain objects without 
losing the ability to embed the mapping files in an assembly.  If the 
assemblies DO NOT also contain the domain classes, then the /m option should be
used to specify the assemblies that do contain the domain classes.

2. If the /d switch is used, then an error could result if you do not use the 
/m switch to specify the assemblies containing the domain classes.

3. You may combine the /a, /d, and /m switches if there are multiple methods by
which your project loads mapping classes and domain files.

4. Both the /s and /v option will result in the create/update/delete script 
being output to stdio. The difference is that the /s option instucts nst to
only output the script, and not actually execute it against the database
